# Streaming

### Summary

- Callbags are a specification for pullable and pushable streams in JavaScript.
- These examples run in a browser without a build process.
- Includes asynchronous callbags for produce, transform (async map), and consume.

### Roadmap

- want to extend "take" to allow for pagination (slice)
- ideas: emit, log, pluck, total/reduce
